# ## Illustrate usage of DAPPER to run MANY benchmark experiments.
#
# Launch many experiments (to explore a bunch of control variables),
# and plot the compiled results as in a variety of ways.
#
# As an example, we will reproduce Figure 6.6 from reference [1].
# The figure reveals the (relative) importance (in the EnKF) of
# localization and inflation. The output of this script is shown here:
# https://github.com/nansencenter/DAPPER#highlights
#
# The code also demonstrates:
# - Parallelization (accross independent experiments) with mp=True/Google.
# - Data management with xpSpace: load, sub-select, print, plot.
#
# NB: unless you have access to the DAPPER cluster, you probably want to reduce
# the number of experiments by shortening the list of `seed`
# (and maybe those of some tuning parameters) and/or reducing `Ko`.
