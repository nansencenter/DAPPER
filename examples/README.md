# Examples

Here are some example scripts using DAPPER.
They all consist of one (or more) synthetic experiments.
They can be run using `python examples/the_script.py`,
or with the `%run` command inside `ipython`.
You can also open the `.py` files in after launching
`jupyter-notebook`, which will convert the scripts
to the notebook format (using the `jupytext` plug-in).

- `basic_1.py`: A single experiment, with Liveplotting.
- `basic_2.py`: Comparison of several DA methods.
- `basic_3.py`: Many DA methods and other experiment settings.
- `param_estim.py`: Similar to `basic_2`, but with parameter estimation.
