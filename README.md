DAPPER is a set of templates for **benchmarking** the performance of
**data assimilation** (DA) methods.
The tests provide experimental support and guidance for
new developments in DA.
The typical set-up is a **synthetic (twin) experiment**, where you
specify a dynamic model and an observational model,
and use these to generate a synthetic truth (multivariate time series),
and then estimate that truth given the models and noisy observations.

## Getting started

[Install](#installation), then
read, run and try to understand `examples/basic_{1,2,3}.py`.
Some of the examples can also be opened in Jupyter, and thereby run in the cloud
(i.e. *without installation*, but requiring Google login): [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](http://colab.research.google.com/github/nansencenter/DAPPER).
This [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtalK0Zkzvg&t=6475s)
provides an introduction.
The [documentation](https://nansencenter.github.io/DAPPER)
includes general guidelines and the API,
but for any serious use you will want to read and adapt the code yourself.
If you use it in a publication, please cite, e.g.,
*The experiments used (inspiration from) DAPPER [ref], version 1.2.1*,
where [ref] points to [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.2029296.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2029296).
Lastly, for an introduction to DA theory also using Python,
see these [tutorials](https://github.com/nansencenter/DA-tutorials).


## Highlights

DAPPER enables the numerical investigation of [DA methods](#da-methods)
through a variety of typical [test cases](#test-cases-models) and statistics. It
(a) reproduces numerical benchmarks results reported in the literature, and
(b) facilitates comparative studies, thus promoting the
(a) reliability and
(b) relevance of the results.
For example, this figure is generated by `examples/basic_3.py`,
making use of built-in tools for experiment and result management,
reproduces figure 5.7 of [these lecture notes](http://cerea.enpc.fr/HomePages/bocquet/teaching/assim-mb-en.pdf).

![Comparative benchmarks with Lorenz'96 plotted as a function of the ensemble size (N)](./docs/imgs/ex3.svg)

DAPPER is (c) open source, written in Python, and (d) focuses on readability;
this promotes the (c) reproduction and (d) dissemination of the underlying science,
and makes it easy to adapt and extend.

It also illustrates how to parallelise ensemble forecasts (e.g. the QG model),
local analyses (e.g. the LETKF), and independent experiments (e.g. `examples/basic_3.py`).
It comes with a battery of diagnostics and statistics.
These all get averaged over subdomains (e..g "ocean" and "land") and then in time.
Confidence intervals are computed, including correction for auto-correlations,
and used for uncertainty quantification, and significant digits printing.
Several diagnostics are included in the on-line "liveplotting" illustrated below,
which may be paused for further interactive inspection.

![EnKF - Lorenz'63](./docs/imgs/ex1.jpg)

<!-- Non-highlighted features:
- Time sequences use via `tools.chronos.Chronology` and `tools.chronos.Ticker`.
- Random variables via `tools.randvars.RV`: Gaussian, Student-t, Laplace, Uniform,
  ..., as well as support for custom sampling functions.
- Covariance matrices via `tools.matrices.CovMat`:
  provides input flexibility/overloading,
  lazy eval that facilitates the use of non-diagonal
  covariance matrices (whether sparse or full).
-->

In summary, DAPPER is well suited for teaching and fundamental DA research.
Also see its [drawbacks](#similar-projects).


## Installation

Successfully tested on Linux/Mac/Windows.

### Prerequisite: Python>=3.9

If you're an expert, setup a python environment however you like.
Otherwise:
Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), then
open the [Anaconda terminal](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#starting-conda)
and run the following commands:

```sh
conda create --yes --name dapper-env python=3.9
conda activate dapper-env
python --version
```

Ensure the printed version is 3.9 or more.  
*Keep using the same terminal for the commands below.*

### Install

#### *Either*: Install for development (recommended)

*Do you want the DAPPER code available to play around with?* Then

- Download and unzip (or `git clone`) DAPPER.
- Move the resulting folder wherever you like,  
  and `cd` into it
  *(ensure you're in the folder with a `setup.py` file)*.
- `pip install -e '.[dev]'`  
  You can omit `[dev]` if you don't need to do serious development.

#### *Or*: Install as library

*Do you just want to run a script that requires DAPPER?* Then

- If the script comes with a `requirements.txt` file, then do  
  `pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt`.
- If not, hopefully you know the version of DAPPER needed. Run  
  `pip install dapper==1.0.0` to get version `1.2.3` (as an example).

#### *Finally*: Test the installation

You should now be able to do run your script with
`python path/to/script.py`.  
For example, if you are in the DAPPER dir,

    python examples/basic_1.py

**PS**: If you closed the terminal (or shut down your computer),
you'll first need to run `conda activate dapper-env`

<sup>1</sup>: Stochastic, DEnKF (i.e. half-update), ETKF (i.e. sym. sqrt.).
Serial forms are also available.  
Tuned with inflation and "random, orthogonal rotations".  
<sup>2</sup>: Also supports the bundle version,
and "EnKF-N"-type inflation.  
<sup>3</sup>: Resampling: multinomial

The particle filter is tuned with "effective-N monitoring",
"regularization/jittering" strength, and more.

- `*`: Flexible; set as necessary
- `**`: Tangent Linear Model included?

The models are found as subdirectories within `dapper/mods`.
A model should be defined in a file named `__init__.py`,
and illustrated by a file named `demo.py`.
Most other files within a model subdirectory
are usually named `authorYEAR.py` and define a `HMM` object,
which holds the settings of a specific twin experiment,
using that model,
as detailed in the corresponding author/year's paper.
A list of these files can be obtained using

```sh
find dapper/mods -iname '[a-z]*[0-9]*.py'
```

Some files contain settings used by several papers.
Moreover, at the bottom of each such file should be (in comments)
a list of suitable, tuned settings for various DA methods,
along with their expected, average `rmse.a` score for that experiment.
As mentioned [above](#da-methods), DAPPER reproduces literature results.
You will also find results that were not reproduced by DAPPER.


## Similar projects

DAPPER is aimed at research and teaching (see discussion up top).
Example of limitations:

- It is not suited for very big models (>60k unknowns).
- Time-dependent error covariances and changes in lengths of state/obs
  (although the `Dyn` and `Obs` models may otherwise be time-dependent).
- Non-uniform time sequences not fully supported.

The scope of DAPPER is restricted because

![framework_to_language](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clim_%7B%5Ctext%7Bflexibility%7D%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty%7D%20%5Ctext%7Bframework%7D%20%3D%20%5Ctext%7Bprog.%20language%7D)

Moreover, even straying beyond basic configurability appears [unrewarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexibility%E2%80%93usability_tradeoff)
when already building on a high-level language such as Python.
Indeed, you may freely fork and modify the code of DAPPER,
which should be seen as a set of templates, and not a framework.

Also, DAPPER comes with no guarantees/support.
Therefore, if you have an *operational* or real-world application,
such as WRF, you should look into one of the alternatives,
sorted by approximate project size.
