Compile as follows...

### This `f90` directory

contains Fortran-90 code for the QG model for building

1. a python extension module `py_mod`
2. a standalone program

DAPPER only requires `py_mod` (also to generate initial sample).
Both require an `f90` compiler (tested with `g95` and `gfortran`).  
In addition  `py_mod` requires `f2py`, while `qg` requires `netcdf` libraries.


### For DAPPER

To build `py_mod`, ensure that both `gcc` and `gfortran` are installed.
For example, with `conda`:

    conda install -c conda-forge gcc
    conda install -c conda-forge gfortran

Then run:

    cd dapper/mods/QG/f90
    rm -rf py_mod.cpython-* __pycache__
    f2py -c utils.f90 parameters.f90 helmholtz.f90 calc.f90 qgflux.f90 qgstep.f90 interface.f90 -m py_mod

### For the standalone executable `qg`

(not required for DAPPER), adapt the `Makefile` to your system, and run

    make qg

Example: here's how I compiled the standalone on my Mac:

    - get netcdf: `brew install netcdf --with-fortran`
    - In makefile, changed to:
          FC = gfortran-5
          NCLIB = /usr/local/lib/libnetcdff.dylib /usr/local/lib/libnetcdf.dylib
    - Matlab has a new netcdf interface. Therefore, qgread.m should use
          % ncdisp(fname)
          ncid = netcdf.open(fname);
          psi  = permute( netcdf.getVar(ncid, netcdf.inqVarID(ncid,'psi')), [3 2 1]);
          q    = permute( netcdf.getVar(ncid, netcdf.inqVarID(ncid,'q'))  , [3 2 1]);
          t    = netcdf.getVar(ncid, netcdf.inqVarID(ncid,'t'));

### Changelog since Sakov's enkf-matlab

    - Rm Matlab interface funcs: qgplay.m qgplot.m qgread.m mexcmd.m qgstep_mex.f90 mexf90.f90
    - Modified makefile, as described above.
    - In parameters.f90:
        - Capitalized m,n
        - Swapped NY1 and NX1 in definitions of M,N
        - Changed typing of arrays in interface.f90, qgflux.f90, qgstep.f90 to allocatable.
    - Made `interface.f90` for Python.
