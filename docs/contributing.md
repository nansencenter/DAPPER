# Contributing to DAPPER

:+1::tada: Firstly, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

Don't hesitate to create Issues or Pull Requests! 
Issues are not limited to code quality. You can also open discussions around the science (engineering?)!

A good place to start is by looking at the "Projects" tab on GitHub/DAPPER.
For example, you can pick out an issue from the upcoming release,
or aim at a bigger one for a more major version release.
If you plan to work on an issue, please tag yourself in the issue.

Also see the [dev-guide](https://nansencenter.github.io/DAPPER/dev_guide.html) in the documentation.

DAPPER is developed by a small team, and our resources are limited, so please be patient if we don't manage to reply at once.
